# higher-lower-followers-game
My take on Higher-Lower game.


<li> We load the dictionary with short summary of the person/institution  and it's social media "followers_count"(unreal data)
<li> User is displayed a ascii logo and some information about items A and B.
<li> Their job is to guess wchich one has bigger followers count.
<li> The goal is to go as long as you can without losig. In dictionary there is 50 records.
