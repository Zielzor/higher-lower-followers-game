# higher-lower-followers-game
My take on Higher-Lower game.

<li> 
  1. We load the dictionary with short summary of the person/institution  and it's social media "followers_count"(unreal data)
  2. User is displayed a ascii logo and some information about items A and B.
  3. Their job is to guess wchich one has bigger followers count.
  4. The goal is to go as long as you can without losig. In dictionary there is 50 records.
